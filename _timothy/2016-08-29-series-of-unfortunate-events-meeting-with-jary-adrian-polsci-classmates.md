### Delayed flight
Last week's Thursday, I travelled from Cebu to Manila, flying through Cebupacific Air.  The flight was supposed to be 03:10 PM PHT.  It was delayed for about 1.5 hours and was announced twice for like 1 hour at first, and 30 minutes at the second announcement.

I arrived in Manila at about quarter to 5 PM and got out of the airport departure area at about 5 PM because I had to wait for luggage queue.

### Delayed uber
I booked for Uber at 5 PM outside the departure area, terminal 3, and waited for the Uber car to arrive.  I waited up to more than 30 minutes.  But from the start, I noticed that the cars outside the departure area aren't moving.  They are in static mode.  Their position stays the same for 30 minutes.  I asked some fixer there if I can get a cab just to get out of that airport, but it costs thousands.  I decided, with my bag and 1 stroller luggage, to walk from the airport out.  I did not cancel my Uber yet, because I will be passing by his car when I leave the airport by foot.  I walked until I reached the car, but I did not bother anymore.  The cars aren't moving, and I don't want to sit inside my booked uber car to be charged just for an aircon.  I asked the driver to cancel my booking because if I do it personally, I will be charged 100 pesos as per their rules.  I walked until I reached seven eleven outside.  It has been more than an hour since.  It was more than 6 PM already.

### Can't get a cab / jeepney
I stayed outside seven eleven for more than 30 minutes, to get a cab, but, how can I get a cab when the cars aren't moving at all.  Ok, I have decided to wait a little more.  I talked to the traffic enforcer and she informed me that the traffic may reach 9 PM.  I decided to walk, until I reach Rotonda.  I don't even know where is that, I just know the direction though as instructed by the traffic enforcer.

### Riding a bike with a sidecar
As I walk, I passed by a pedicab, a bike having a sidecar.  It's small, so I decided to rent it.  He charged me 100 pesos to reach Rotonda.  It was my first time to ride it in Manila.  While other cars aren't moving due to traffic, I am passing by them inhaling all the smokes and street dusts.  The driver passed by some unusual routes to avoid the traffic.  It was fun.  I was sweating like never before.  I was so tired already.

### Can't get a cab a cab the second time
In Rotonda, I waited for a cab to get me to Don Bosco, Makati.  It seems that all cabs are full, and there are instances where cabs are available but their drivers are not willing to take me to Don Bosco because the latter is very traffic.
